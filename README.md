# Sky360 Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains Unity 3D projects providing a basic simulation system,
capable of creating video content to test the tracker.

Environment, virtual camera and target objects are fully customizable using the
basic elements of Unity games, GameObjects and behaviors.

In the future, evaluation of tracker performance may be enabled using ground
truth trajectory information recorded by the simulated object behaviors.
